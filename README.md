Introduction:

The rapid increase in the generation of waste due to continuous growth in the urbanization and industrialization has become a severe problem for the authorities to manage the wastes being dumped everywhere as landfills. To ensure the minimal risk to the environment and human health, it is necessary to take meticulous measures when segregating waste and that too at source. 
	
Even though there are large-scale industrial waste segregators present, it is always much better to segregate the waste at the source itself as a higher quality of the material could be retained for recycling which means that more value could be recovered from the waste and also the occupational hazard of waste workers is reduced and also the segregated waste could be directly sent to the recycling and processing plant instead of sending it to the segregation plant and then to the recycling plant thereby reducing a great amount of work.

Segregation of waste in a proper manner is not only helpful to the environment but also brings to the limelight the actual economic value of the waste and energy producing value of waste. The traditional method used for segregating of waste in India is through rag pickers which are time-consuming and can have adverse effects on the health of the people who are exposed to such wastes. 

Solution:

The proposal is the use of a tool in the name of “Waste Segregation Management with Status Detection” which is to be used in places where waste is generated (predominantly houses and educational institutions) as this tool segregates waste based on the measures of ‘bio-degradability’.

The Trash Can (Dust Bin) will hold an image processing camera under which the garbage/trash object is to be kept. This tool will process the image of the trash object kept under its view and would find out where to move the trash based on the bio-degradability of the trash object. 

That information is sent to the microcontroller which in turn sends instruction to the motor to turn the lid to the respective side the trash object should be dropped thereby segregating the trash object based on its bio-degradability into the respective side of the trash/garbage bin. 

Another important feature of the project is Status Detection, which would be very useful especially in places where there is an uncertainty in the frequency of trash being put into the bin as we would be using specific sensors to detect the used level of the bin and so in case of the bin being full, the sensor will automatically send this information to the microcontroller which will in turn send a message to the administrator this information that the bin is full with the help of another type of modules.

The purpose of this project is the realization of a compact, low cost, and user-friendly segregation system for urban households, offices, educational institutions, restaurants to streamline the waste management process.
